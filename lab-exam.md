###Lab Exam Information

The lab exam will be held in **Week 47 (November 22nd and 23rd 2018)** (Final).
Exact day and time will be provided in a separate schedule.
 
1. Examination is individual (only demo part is combined) and covers only lab 6. 

2. It is meant to be a demo session, where you show that your joint lab is
working, and you will be asked to run different parts of the program(s) that
you have developed, and we will also ask questions about the code.

3. Students are expected to know and be able to explain all the code in the
relevant lab exercises, even though your group partner wrote that particular
piece of code.

4. Your individual lab grade will be based on the lab handin and the lab exam.

5. Your grade will be announced at a later time after all students have
completed their lab exam.

6. If you have already passed the lab exam in a previous year, you do not need
to do the lab exercises again, if you only want to improve your written exam
grade. If you want to improve your lab grade, you will need to complete the lab 
exercises again. *Warning: It is a lot of work (as you know), and we may also 
change the lab exercises from one year to the next.*

7. Completing the lab exam is not a pre-requisite for attending the written
exam, but to get a final grade in the course, a passing grade is required for
both the lab exam and the written exam.
